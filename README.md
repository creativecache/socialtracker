# Social Tracker

Creative Cache's Social Tracker for businesses to track their follower count across several social medias accounts.

## Getting Started

Download a .zip of these files or simply visit the online [Social Tracker](http://creativecache.us/social-tracker/).

### Add Social Usernames

Once on the website (or setup locally) input the usernames of the social media accounts you wish to view the follower count of. No need to add any symbols like @, just the username. You may add all fields or select certain social media accounts. Once done click the Submit Button.

## How It Works

The tracker will create a browser cookie with the usernames you have entered to keep track. Therefore, if you reload the page it will remember your usernames and simply refresh the counts.

## The Menu

Click the stack menu in the upper right to return to the login screen.

### Modifying Usernames

Simply type over the usernames in the fields and click the Submit Button to change them. Click the Clear Stored Usernames option to clear the cookies for the saved usernames.
